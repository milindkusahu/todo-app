# Todo App by Milind

A simple and interactive Todo App built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to create, mark as completed, and delete tasks, with data persistence using localStorage.

## Features

- Add new tasks to your todo list
- Mark tasks as completed
- Delete individual tasks
- Clear all tasks at once
- Data persistence using localStorage

## Getting Started

To get started with the Todo App, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/milindkusahu/todo-app.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd todo-app
   ```

3. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## Usage

- Enter a task in the input field and press Enter or click the "+" button to add it to the todo list.
- Click on the checkbox next to a task to mark it as completed. The task will be visually strikethrough.
- Click on the "Delete" button next to a task to remove it from the list.
- Click on the "Clear All" button to remove all tasks from the list.

The app automatically saves your tasks in the browser's localStorage, so your data persists even if you refresh the page or close the browser.
